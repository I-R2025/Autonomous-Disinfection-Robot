# Autonomous-Disinfection-Robot
Developed an autonomous ultraviolet (UV) disinfection robot aimed at effectively neutralizing harmful pathogens from surfaces in indoor environments. The system utilizes high-intensity UV-C lamps from Philips, known for their proven germicidal properties, to disinfect targeted areas.

The robot is designed to inactivate a wide range of viruses, including:
-Ebola virus
-Coronaviruses
-Hepatitis
-Influenza
-Poliovirus
-Norovirus
-Lassa virus
To validate the system's efficacy, pre- and post-disinfection samples were collected and cultured. Experimental results demonstrated a pathogen reduction of 99.9%, confirming the robot's effectiveness in clinical and real-world scenarios.

‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical and Electrical Design
Base Configuration:
The robot features a differential drive base supported by two caster wheels at the front and two at the rear for stability.

Drive System:
Two Maxon RE40 motors controlled via EPOS motor controllers handle locomotion.
Wheel encoder data is published to the /odom topic using the udr_pkg.

Power Supply:
Powered by a 48V battery system
Inverter used to supply regulated AC/DC power to:

SBC (Single Board Computer)
UV Lamps
Digital output channels control lamp activation.
PIR sensors (Passive Infrared Sensors) monitor human presence to automatically switch off UV lamps for safety.

üß≠Explaination of ROS developed framework

Sensor Suite:

urg_node pkg: 
Hokuyo Lidars are mounted at the front and rear to enable 360¬∞ coverage using the urg_node package.The lidars publish the laser scan at topics /scan1 and /scan2.

ira_laser_tools pkg:
It merge laser scans /scan1 and /scan2 to a sungle laser scan /scan.This configuration supports both forward and reverse navigation. 

urdf_udr pkg:
This package contains the URDF model of the robot, which can be visualized in RViz.It provides robot_state_publisher node, which uses the robot's urdf that provides transformation of all robot's static links (like sensors or a fixed camera mount) and dynamic joints (like a robotic arm's joints) attached to the base_link i.e. form base_link -> other links. The model is designed in solidworks and the sw_urdf_exporter plugin is used to generate its urdf ROS pkg.

SLAM Toolbox pkg:
It is used to to generate and refine a 2D occupancy grid map.

openzenros:
IMU (LPMS-IG1) is integrated using the openzen_sensor driver to publish data on the /imu topic.

udr_pkg:
RE40 with EPOS Controllers are used to dive diffrential drive. It subscroibes the /cmd_vel to drive the robot and publishes /odom using wheels encoder feedback. /odom provides transformation from odom -> base link. It tells the robot where it is right now, but only in relation to where it started. It's the robot's local, continuous estimate of its position.

robot_localization_pkg:
It fuses the sensors data like /imu and /odom to localize the robot using /odometery /filtered. The filtered version use Kalman filter, that combines the strengths of multiple sensors while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

map_server pkg:
The map_server loads map files generated through slam_toolbox through teleop. It publishes the map data on the /map topic, 

udr_navigation:
It consist of:
amcl_pkg:
It localize the robot using  a pre-built map /map, filtered odometry /odometry/filetered for a smooth local estimate, and live laser scan /scan for comparison. By using a particle filter, it compares the scans against the map to correct the odometry's drift. Provides transformation from map -> odom.

move_base pkg:
It launch the move_base node, which is the brain for obot's autonomous navigation. It sets up two "planners"‚Äîone for long-term planning and one for immediate decisions.It creates a "global map" of the entire environment and a smaller, constantly-updating "local map" for avoiding new obstacles. It loads all the detailed settings for how these planners and maps should work from several .yaml files in udr_navigation package. 

Planner setup:
    Global Planner: Uses NavfnROS to plan a high-level, safe path from your starting point to your final destination, using the static global map.
    Local Planner: Uses DWAPlannerROS to make fast, real-time adjustments to the path, helping the robot avoid any unexpected obstacles that appear. 
Map setup:
    Costmaps: The file loads common settings for both the global and local maps from costmap_common.yaml.
    Local Costmap: Creates a small, rolling window map (10m x 10m) around the robot using costmap_local.yaml and sensor data, so the robot can avoid new obstacles.
    Global Costmap: Sets up a larger, static map. It uses costmap_global_static.yaml with a pre-existing map unless the no_static_map argument is used, in which case it uses a dynamic global map based on costmap_global_laser.yaml. 

üîê Safety Features
PIR Sensors:
They detect human presence in the vicinity. If any motion is detected near the robot, UV lamps are immediately turned off to prevent human exposure to UV-C radiation. They are configured as Epos controller Digital Input.

UVC Lamps:
They take ac power as input so inverter with battery is used to power them up. The ac power can be switched ON and OFF using a relay in its path. A relay is configured as digital output of Epos controller. So in other words the lamps can be switched on and off using digital output. So, as PIR sensor digital Input turned 1 it set lamps Digital Ouput to 0.

üß™ Testing Without Hardware
If you do not currently have access to the hardware, you can still test the robot's software stack in a simulation environment using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
<pre> <code> git clone https://github.com/I-R2025/Autonomous-Disinfection-Robot.git</code> </pre>

2. Navigate to the workspace
<pre> <code>cd Autonomous-Disinfection-Robot/slam_ws</code> </pre>

3. Build the workspace
<pre> <code>catkin_make</code> </pre>

4. Source the setup file
<pre> <code>source devel/setup.bash</code> </pre>

5. Launch ROS Core
<pre> <code>roscore</code> </pre>

6. In new terminal tabs or windows, run the following
-Publish static transforms
<pre> <code>rosrun tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 odom base_link</code> </pre>
<pre> <code>rosrun tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 map odom</code> </pre>

-Load a sample map
<pre> <code>rosrun map_server map_server src/maps/default.yaml</code> </pre>

-Launch the URDF model in RViz
<pre> <code>roslaunch urdf_udr_new display.launch</code> </pre>

This will allow you to visualize the robot's URDF and simulated transforms in RViz without needing the physical robot.
